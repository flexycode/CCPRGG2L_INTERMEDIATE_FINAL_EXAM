## [Introduction](#introduction)
This repository contains source code for our final project for intermediate java that focuses on Intermediate concepts, codes and exercises.

#### Course Description:
This course is a continuation of CCPRGG1L - Fundamentals of Programming. The course covers advanced topics in Java to train students in developing robust programs. Topics to be covered include recursion, regular expression, basic object-oriented principles, graphics, and multithreaded programming.

#### Course outcomes:
At the end of the course, the studend must be able to: 
1. Create a program that uses recursions and regular expressions
2. Implement Object-Oriented in program design
3. Create and document application that uses a modern graphical user interface (GUI)

#### Code Structure Explanation:

💻 The code tree structure that I provided follows the principles of a software architectural pattern known as the "Package by Feature" or "Package by Component" pattern. This pattern is commonly used in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and is particularly prevalent in frameworks and libraries that promote a modular and component-based approach to application development.

#### Code Requirements:
* 🚀 Download [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc) 64 bit. Depends on your jdk version if lower jdk need 32 bit
* 🚀 Download and use [Intellij Idea Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows)
* 🚀 Understand the Code Tree Structure of [Artificial Ledger Bank](https://github.com/flexycode/CCPRGG2L_INTERMEDIATE_FINAL_EXAM?tab=readme-ov-file#-code-project-structure-using-maven)
* 🚀 Locate the designated important file such as video, resources file like wav, png, jpg in appropriate directory file in your Idea folder located in your system drive or C:\drive.
Example: C:\Users\eimifukuda\IdeaProjects\ArtificialLedger\

##### The best IDE to run this Application is to use IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition

* 💻 IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition - Good for personal project, Git Integration features and tons of useful features, easy to use and eye freshing UI theme. The only downside of this is that you need to enable your Microsoft security anti-malware to be able to install this IDE. You cannot store multiple java project unlike Eclipse.
   
* 💻 Eclipse - Best choice for every Java Developer out there, best for storing multiple java project because of the workspace features on this IDE. But if you're trying to run this project, you need to downgrade your JDK version into 8 and figure-out how to crack those installation lols.   

* 💻 Visual Studio Code - I've never try to run this project in this IDE during the development period. The only main issue on this IDE is that you need to figure-out what extention to be install before you can run your Java file.          

* 💻 XCode - I dont know, I don't have Macbook and not a fan of that $hit lols.

* 💻 Apache Netbeans - I just saw this IDE on Youtube tutorial, good for designing GUI and UI for java project. Best IDE for Java development to use and to know if you want to become a Java Developer lols. 

* 💻 Vim - Do you want your life to become miserable? Use this IDE instead :D

* 💻 NeoVim - IDE for Alien being, not human being.

### 🛸 Reporting Issues

```bash
Some changes need to be address
- Need to limit the Pin Code to 6 character input only just like in the Real Bank, example 123456
- Fix the GUI for Login and Account Class
- Fix some method in Account Class, for every transaction such Withdrawal, Deposit and Balance Inquiry. It needs to have Pin Code for every transaction.

```
